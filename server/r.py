"Profile": "A new era has begun and for now, at least, it belongs to Erling Haaland. The relentless striker has scored 50 goals for club and country so far in 2023, delivering Manchester City a treble and the Champions League holy grail in his first season. Highlights included a five-goal haul against RB Leipzig and two crucial strikes against Bayern Munich as he became the youngest player to reach 40 goals in Europe’s top competition. This season Haaland has proved his phenomenal start to life in England was no statistical freak, taking his City goal tally to 71 inside 18 months. A hulking on-field presence with an outrageous turn of pace, it is easy to forget Haaland is only 23. He is the youngest player to top our annual men’s poll, and the first plying his trade in the Premier League. He is also a clear winner of our list – 146 judges put him top, with another 40 panellists awarding him second place.",

Must have big pockets, because he has managed to fit the entire Santiago Bernabéu inside. His goal celebration, arms wide, has become iconic and often imitated, not least because it has been so often repeated, his goalscoring start to his Real Madrid career better than anyone else’s, ever. “He’s a gift for football,” the coach, Carlo Ancelotti, says. It is an understatement. Twenty-one judges had him top and 211 of our 218 voters had him in their top 40. And he is only going to get better. ",

Once he returned, though, he picked up where he left off and continued to score at a blistering pace, averaging more than a goal per game in the league. But another standoff with the club looms large, and Mbappé’s potential involvement in the Olympics is increasingly likely to be his send-off from his home city.",

After Kane had netted twice against Galatasaray in November, his manager, Thomas Tuchel, said: \"I can't tell you anything more than I did at the start of the season. His performances, his goal ratio, his games, they tell the story. No more words needed.\" His time at Tottenham ended with the team in disarray as Antonio Conte's reign blew up.

The Spain midfielder is the team’s heartbeat, a precise cog that turns the gears in Pep Guardiola’s trophy-winning machine. It is Rodri’s distribution and ball-winning abilities that have allowed his manager more flexibility, from the swarming high-tempo passing that suffocated Real Madrid to the sweeping counters that sank Arsenal. City are simply not the same force without Rodri in the control room. Not all his best work is behind the scenes, though – it was his instinctive strike that broke the deadlock in a fraught Champions League final, the highlight of a breakthrough year that sees him soar from outside the top 50 all the way into the top five.",

"Profile": "Sometimes you only know someone’s true worth when they are gone, and Ilkay Gündogan’s absence from Manchester City’s midfield this season is glaring. His control and goals made him arguably City’s most important player behind Erling Haaland last season. His move to Barcelona has not been without problems and he openly criticised his new teammates for not showing “more frustration, more anger and more disappointment” after their clásico defeat to Real Madrid. But the 33-year-old is already a leader for Xavi – at the time of writing there have been only two matches since August where he has not played the full 90 minutes. ",

Having been Argentina’s No 9 in Qatar, Álvarez has generally operated out wide for City, particularly since the departure of Riyad Mahrez.

Since his explosion, aged 18 at Euro 2020, immediately after which he went to the Olympics, repeated injuries have limited Pedri to 38 league starts from a possible 90 and he has not played for Spain in 2023. He was not called up in the last international window despite getting fit again, but will be if he can stay that way. “Pedri is a super-class, we’re counting on him for everything,” Spain manager Luis de la Fuente said.",

If it previously felt like Rodrygo ceded to his teammates, now they look to him to be the difference. It is clear Madrid see him as their present and future – last month the 22-year-old earned a new contract until 2028, with a reported €1bn release clause. Rodrygo's versatility is a strength but it will be interesting to see if his role shifts again with the arrival of Endrick (and possibly Kylian Mbappé) next summer.",

The goals and assists are beginning to flow but numbers seem like a vulgar way to describe such an uncommon talent who has helped to make his team not just the Bundesliga’s best in the back half of 2023, but its most thrilling.",

As Howe puts it: “Kieran has been the catalyst of so many of the good things which have happened here.” A favourite of not merely Newcastle’s manager but England’s coach, Gareth Southgate, the streetwise former Atlético Madrid defender can operate at left-back as well as his preferred right-back role. A dead-ball wizard, not to mention a fine crosser, Trippier also represents a stellar attacking outlet.",

Italy should sleep peacefully.” Bastoni was already starting regularly for Inter by that stage, with a handful of international appearances under his belt. Now, at 24 years old, he is an essential component of a defence that kept 10 clean sheets in its first 15 Serie A games of the current campaign. He has 21 caps for Italy and can look forward to playing a vital role in the Euros next summer.",

"Profile": "Paolo Maldini’s five-year run as Milan’s technical director ended in June, but before being ushered out the door the former club captain offered effusive praise for the player occupying his old spot at left-back. “Nobody else does what [Theo] does,” said Maldini. “He’s got the ability to finish, serve assists and come inside. He has revolutionised the modern idea of the role.” How many other defenders, after all, mark each year with a spectacular coast-to-coast goal? After Atalanta in 2022, Lazio were Hernández’s victims this time around. He has shown his versatility by filling in at centre-back during Milan’s recent injury crisis, too.",

"Profile": "Davies hangs on in the list, but is down 32 places from last year and even further from his 2020 peak of 23rd. The Canadian was arguably the greatest left-back in the world, despite being freshly converted to the post, as a key part of Bayern’s treble winners. Since then he has suffered from the team’s all-round defensive instability; when David Alaba was next to him, Davies could make irresistible runs forward knowing he would be covered and was ably shepherded through the defensive side of the game. He remains technically accomplished and tidy but perhaps a new challenge would help to continue his development.",

Dumfries has been accused in the past of lacking subtlety, leaning too heavily on his pace and power, but has refined his game under Simone Inzaghi at Inter and continues to improve at 27 years old.",

Scored on his recall to the England squad in October and has added key goals for Villa, helping the club become genuine title contenders. A fruitful loan to sixth-tier Weston-super-Mare, from boyhood club Exeter City, while a nippy 18-year-old forward feels a lifetime ago now. Watkins is in the box-seat to be back-up to Harry Kane at Euro 2024. ",

The chance to join PSG from Gladbach was turned down despite Kylian Mbappé wanting to play alongside him. His impressive form at San Siro has led to greater involvement in the France national side, suggesting it was the correct choice.",
